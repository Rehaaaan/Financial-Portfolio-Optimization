## Project Overview

This project focuses on financial portfolio optimization using historical stock price data. By leveraging various data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to construct an optimal portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. The tools and libraries used in this project include Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, cvxopt, yfinance), Excel, and Tableau.

## Project Approach

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect historical stock prices data from Yahoo Finance using Python's `yfinance` library.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values and ensure proper date formatting.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Calculate key financial metrics such as returns, volatility, and correlations using Python.
   - Example code:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     import numpy as np

     # Calculate daily returns
     returns = pf_data.pct_change().dropna()

     # Calculate average returns and volatility
     avg_returns = returns.mean() * 250
     volatility = returns.std() * np.sqrt(250)
     ```

4. **Optimization Modeling:**
   - Implement Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization using Python libraries (`numpy`, `cvxopt`).
   - Example code:
     ```python
     from cvxopt import matrix, solvers

     def portfolio_optimization(returns, cov_matrix):
         n = len(returns)
         P = matrix(cov_matrix)
         q = matrix(np.zeros(n))
         G = matrix(np.diag(np.ones(n) * -1))
         h = matrix(np.zeros(n))
         A = matrix(np.ones((1, n)))
         b = matrix(1.0)

         sol = solvers.qp(P, q, G, h, A, b)
         weights = sol['x']
         return weights
     ```

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Use Excel and Tableau to create visualizations of portfolio performance and risk-return analysis.
   - Develop an interactive dashboard in Tableau displaying the optimized portfolio and risk-return trade-offs.

6. **Business Intelligence Reporting:**
   - Compile the optimization analysis and visualizations into a comprehensive report using Tableau.
   - Provide actionable insights and recommendations for portfolio management.

## Aim

The primary aim of this project is to analyze and optimize a financial portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risk using historical stock price data. By employing advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we seek to identify the optimal combination of assets that achieve the best trade-off between risk and return.

## Visuals

1. **Portfolio Returns vs. Volatility:**
   - Scatter plot of 5000 random portfolios showing the relationship between expected returns and volatility.

2. **Optimal Portfolios:**
   - Highlighting portfolios with maximum return and minimum volatility.

3. **Correlation Matrix:**
   - Heatmap displaying the correlations between different assets in the portfolio.

## Results

- **Maximum Return Portfolio:**
  - Return: xx%
  - Volatility: xx%
  - Asset Weights: [weights]

- **Minimum Volatility Portfolio:**
  - Return: xx%
  - Volatility: xx%
  - Asset Weights: [weights]

- **Correlation Matrix:**
  - Visual representation of asset correlations.

## Directory Structure
